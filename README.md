# Dividing the Last Pizza Slice

Drag left and right on the pizza slice at the [**Last Pizza Slice**](http://pizza.dlma.com).  Notice how the the straight horizontal cut that evenly divides the pizza moves up and down a little?  That's it. That's all this website does. We're done here.

## Origin

My middle-school-aged son asked me how one would cut such a slice of pizza, given that it was a 14-inch pizza, and it had eight slices, so each slice's angle, &theta;, was 45&deg;.

It took me longer than it should have to figure it out. I knew it'd be possible, but my trigonometry was rusty.

Of course, having eventually solved the simple problem, I began to suspect that the location of the cut would move subtly if you vary the angle of the slice. Obviously, that calls for an open-source website, and here we are.

## Even More Interesting: When &theta; &gt; 1.9 radians

Once &theta; grows to be over 1.9 radians the problem became more interesting [and I had some trouble coming to a solution](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154042850971561&set=a.10150887996666561.410585.687611560&type=3&theater). The shapes of the two halves require more complicated math.

Being confronted with that challenge was irresistable.

## Is it any good?
